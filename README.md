ARMD-Initial-Setup
==================

AndrewRMinion Design Initial Setup

A plugin that sets up a few basic things on new WordPress installs.

#Tasks
- Update the `start_of_week` to be Sunday
- Format the time to display as 5:47 AM
- Update the timezone to New York
- Disable comments by default
- Show a page rather than posts on the front page, create an **Updates** page for the posts archive, and an **Updating Instructions** page for internal use
- Remove the default page and post created by WordPress
- Update the default user to my name/email address

#Future Ideas
- Enable XML-RPC
- Install several plugins ([WP Remote](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wpremote/), [Google Analytics](http://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/), [Peterâ€™s Login Redirect](wordpress.org/extend/plugins/peters-login-redirect/)
- Delete some older default themes and plugins
